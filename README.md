# ANS_test
This repository contains all files necessary to run the ANS (Approximate Numerosity Sense) test. 
The test is run by opening the 'ClickHere' file and following the instructions written in it.
The ANS_resource file contains all the code required to run the test. The jpg files are shown to test participants 
and are included so that the ANS_resource file can access them. The requirements text file includes all libraries that
need to be installed in a workplace for the test to run.
